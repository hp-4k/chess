# Chess

This is a Ruby command line implementation of chess where two human players can play against each other. The gamme was written as the final project of the Ruby section of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/ruby-final-project) curriculum.

The game prevents the players from making illegal moves and detects checks, check mates and stalemates. The players are able to save the game at any given moment. The board is graphically represented using Unicode chess characters.

I followed TDD principles throughout the game's development. A suite of RSpec tests testing all key functionalities and features is provided in the spec/ folder.
